# Hand-Gesture-Based-PC-Controller
This project was made for our CSE 316 MicroController course project. We used an ultrasonic distance sensor (**HC-SR04**) to detect different hand motions.
A python library **pyautogui** can simulate keypress. We used this library to simulate the keypresses after detecting the handmotions.
